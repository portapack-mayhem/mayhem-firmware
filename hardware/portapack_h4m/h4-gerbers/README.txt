Portapack H4 is an add-on for the HackRF Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform.

The improvements of H4:
1.GPIO port! The H4M adds a GPIO port so users can make their own add-ons for the H4M, just like the flipper.
2.Advanced battery management IC (battery %, voltage, current/draw, etc...)
3.Single power on/off switch.
4.When powered off, the battery will no longer phantom drain.
5.flat design, going back to the iPod style click wheel. (so no more broken buttons and encoders!)
6.Improved charge speeds.
7.Built in mic (and mic switch between internal and external).
8.Matte screen.
