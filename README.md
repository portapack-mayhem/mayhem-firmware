This is a fork of the [Havoc](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/) firmware, which itself was a fork of the [PortaPack](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf) firmware, an add-on for the [HackRF](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/). A fork is a derivate, in this case one that has extra features and fixes when compared to the older versions.

# Frequently Asked Questions

This repository expands upon the previous work by many people and aims to constantly add new features, bugfixes and generate documentation to make further development easier.  [Collaboration](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/How-to-collaborate) is always welcomed and appreciated.

## What to buy?

:heavy_check_mark: A recommended one is this [PortaPack H2](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmU7GQX) pack, that includes everything you need. Sadly, the people making the H2 never made the updated schematics available (against the terms of the license). 

:heavy_check_mark: Another popular option is the clone of the [PortaPack H1](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dkbqs2X).

:warning: Be cautious , *ask* the seller about compatibility with the latest releases. Look out for the description of the item, if they provide the firmware files for an older version or they have custom setup instructions, this means it might be **NOT compatible**, for example:

:warning: If it looks **too different**, this might mean that they are using their own recipe, check the [different models](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/PortaPack-Versions) in our wiki. For example all the H3 and clones of that version use their own version of the firmware. They do not contribute the changes back and eventually you will be left with a device that nobody maintains:

## Where is the latest version?

The current **stable release** is on the [![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/eried/portapack-mayhem?label=Releases&style=social)](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases/latest) page.
