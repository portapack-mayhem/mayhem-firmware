# PortaPack Mayhem

[![Nightly Release](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/actions/workflows/create_nightly_release.yml/badge.svg?branch=next)](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/actions/workflows/create_nightly_release.yml) [![CodeScene Code Health](https://codescene.io/projects/8381/status-badges/code-health)](https://codescene.io/projects/8381) [![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/total)](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/releases) [![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/latest/total)](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/releases/latest) [![Docker Hub Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/eried/portapack.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/eried/portapack) [![Discord Chat](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/tuwVMv3?style=flat)](https://discord.gg/tuwVMv3)

This is a fork of the [Havoc](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/) firmware, which itself was a fork of the [PortaPack](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf) firmware, an add-on for the [HackRF](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/). A fork is a derivate, in this case one that has extra features and fixes when compared to the older versions.

# Frequently Asked Questions

This repository expands upon the previous work by many people and aims to constantly add new features, bugfixes and generate documentation to make further development easier.  [Collaboration](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/wiki/How-to-collaborate) is always welcomed and appreciated.

## What to buy?

:heavy_check_mark: ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-yellow) The fabulous [PortaPack H4M Mayhem](https://grabify.link/VPMPSL), featuring numerous improvements and accessories. Sold by our friends at [OpenSourceSDRLab](https://grabify.link/99SAMT). Join their giveaways on discord (check the badge on top).

:heavy_check_mark: A recommended one is this [PortaPack H2](https://grabify.link/ZYYPLB), that includes everything you need with the plastic case "inspired" on [this](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/wiki/H2-Enclosure).

:heavy_check_mark: Some individuals lean towards the [H2 with a metal enclosure](https://grabify.link/XNGTAP), but its advantages remain debated. Share your insights on our [wiki](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/wiki/Hardware-overview). 

:warning: Be cautious , *ask* the seller about compatibility with the latest releases. Look out for the description of the item, if they provide the firmware files for an older version or they have custom setup instructions, this means it might be **NOT compatible**, for example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1091420/214579017-9ad970b9-0917-48f6-a550-588226d3f89b.png)

:warning: If it looks **too different**, this might mean that they are using their own recipe, check the [different models](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware/wiki/PortaPack-Versions) in our wiki. For example all the H3 and clones of that version use their own version of the firmware. They do not contribute the changes back and eventually you will be left with a device that nobody maintains:
