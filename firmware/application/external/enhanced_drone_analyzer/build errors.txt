# Firmware Build Errors Log - Enhanced Drone Analyzer Analysis
# Latest build attempt: 2025-10-20
# Contains current actionable errors preventing successful compilation
# Previous outdated link-time errors removed

# CRITICAL COMPILATION BLOCKERS (CURRENT BUILD ATTEMPT):
# Project fails at earliest compilation stage due to preprocessor macro issues
# GCC v10.3.1 unable to process duplicate macro definitions
# ERROR: "macro names must be identifiers" (70+ instances across all Chibios objects)
# ROOT CAUSE: CMake toolchain duplicates -DVERSION_STRING="7eed5301" flag excessively
# AFFECTS: All baseband and application object compilations
# STATUS: Requires CMake toolchain fix before any code can be built

# BUILD ENVIRONMENT ISSUES (CURRENT):
# FAILED: libopencm3_hackrf_usb subproject - missing 'make' utility on Windows
# FAILED: hackrf_cpld_data.cpp generation - platform 'avr32' unrecognized
# FAILED: Multiple CPLD data extraction failures (portapack_cpld_*.cpp generation)

# APPLICATION CPLD DATA GENERATION ERRORS (CURRENT):
# These prevent CPLD header generation and halt build at configuration stage
# FAILED: firmware/application/portapack_cpld_20170522_data.cpp
# FAILED: firmware/application/portapack_cpld_20150901_data.cpp
# FAILED: firmware/application/hackrf_cpld_data.cpp

# STATIC ANALYSIS FINDINGS (INFORMATIONAL - NON-BLOCKING):
# CPPCHECK REPORTS:
# - Missing header inclusions for Portapack UI framework components
# - Several unused utility functions in large codebases
# - Implicit constructor definitions could be explicit
# - Parameter passing optimizations recommended (const ref)
# - Variable scope reductions possible
# - STL algorithm usage optimizations
# - Memory management pattern consistency suggestions

# ENHANCED DRONE ANALYZER APP STATUS:
# Code analysis complete - no direct compilation errors found in EDA application code
# All required files present and properly registered in build system
# App registration in EXTAPPLIST confirmed correct
# App architecture follows Portapack external application patterns
# External app compilation not reached due to early framework failures

# CORRECTION PRIORITIES (DESCENDING ORDER):
# 1. URGENT: Fix CMake toolchain duplicate defines preventing GCC compilation
# 2. Install GNU make utility for Windows build environment
# 3. Resolve CPLD data extraction tools/platform issues
# 4. Consider GCC toolchain downgrade to v9.2.1 for better compatibility
# 5. Address code quality issues in separate refactor cycle
