# Firmware Build Errors Log - Enhanced Drone Analyzer Analysis
# This file contains actual compilation errors from the latest build attempt
# Resolved errors have been removed; only current failing items remain

# CHIBIOS/BASEBAND COMPILATION FAILURES (PREFERENTIAL LINKER ERRORS - LINK TIME)
# These occur when baseband objects fail to link properly due to missing dependencies or ordering issues

# APPLICATION CPLD DATA FAILURES
# These are related to CPLD bitstream processing and may be resolved by ensuring CPLD tools are properly configured

# CPPCHECK-STYLE CODE QUALITY ISSUES (INFORMATIONAL)
# These are static analysis findings that may affect code correctness:
# - MissingIncludes: Portapack headers (ui_*.hpp) - expected in build environment
# - UnusedFunctions: Several utility functions not used in current code paths
# - NonExplicitConstructors: Some classes could benefit from explicit constructors
# - Style issues: Parameter passing by const ref, STL algorithm usage
# - Potential bugs: Variable scope reductions, parameter handling

# ENHANCED DRONE ANALYZER SPECIFIC ISSUES:
# Code analysis complete - no direct compilation errors found in EDA code paths
# All required files are present and properly registered in external.cmake
# App registration in EXTAPPLIST confirmed

# BUILD RECOMMENDATION:
# Focus on resolving CPLD data extraction failures first, then baseband linking issues
# Enhanced Drone Analyzer app code appears to be syntactically correct
