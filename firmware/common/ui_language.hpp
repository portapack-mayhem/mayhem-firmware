/*

The purpose of this: when creating an ext app it's address will be changed. But the compiler doesn't know this, so when it optimizes literals it can remove something from one ext app, that is included in the other, to save space.
But when we want to run this app, it won't find the literal at the fake address, so the best case we'll get just garbage or nothing instead of the string.
So we must use this Language helper that stores the literals in the fw instead of any ext app, so it'll be always available.
In the first run we must move those string literal here what are not so unique, like "OK".
