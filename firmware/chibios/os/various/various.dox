 * @brief   Utilities Library.
 * @details This is a collection of useful library code that is not part of
 *          the base kernel services.
 * <h2>Notes</h2>
 * The library code does not follow the same naming convention of the
 * system APIs in order to make very clear that it is not "core" code.<br>
 * The main difference is that library code is not formally  tested in the
 * test suite but through usage in the various demo applications.
