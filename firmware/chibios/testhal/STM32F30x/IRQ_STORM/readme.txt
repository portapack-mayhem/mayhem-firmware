** ChibiOS/RT HAL - IRQ_STORM stress test demo for STM32F30x.              **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo runs on an STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery board.

** The Demo **

The application demonstrates the use of the STM32F30x GPT, PAL and Serial
drivers in order to implement a system stress demo.

** Board Setup **

- Connect an RS232 transceiver to pins PA9(TX) and PA10(RX).
- Connect a terminal emulator to the transceiver (38400-N-8-1).

** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested using the free Codesourcery GCC-based toolchain
and YAGARTO.
Just modify the TRGT line in the makefile in order to use different GCC ports.
