This folder contains the system files that
could be overwritten during updating.

You can of course edit files/dirs here,
however it's not necessary at all.

You can add your own
lists/ replay files/ playlist files
in the /USR/ dir of your sdcard.

Firmware will settle your files
and system files automatically;
so you won't need to combime and merge
them together every update.
