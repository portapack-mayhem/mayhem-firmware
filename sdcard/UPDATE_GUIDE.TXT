Your personal files (Capture, log, frequency lists, etc)
should be saved in the folders except /SYS folder.

The /SYS folder contains official release SD Card
resources files. It is recommended that users should
not store files in the /SYS folder, so that the /SYS
folder can be replaced easily when updating the
SD Card contents.

The /FIRMWARE folder and /APPS folder are
automatically controlled by serial flash updating
or .tar file flashing;
If you want to update firmware and apps:
you only need to use hackrf.app web serial PWA app,
or copy the .tar package into the /FIRMWARE folder
and then run the Flash Utility app.

If you want to update official release SD Card
resources files:
simply replace (or delete and paste) the entire /SYS
folder, since your personal files are not in it.
