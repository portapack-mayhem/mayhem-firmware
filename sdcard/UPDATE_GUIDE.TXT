- Your personal files (Capture, log, personal lists, etc) are storage in /USR/

- The /RES/ only contains official release blob files,
which is not suggested to edit or save things into it;
So you can easily replace it during updating.

- The /FIRMWARE folder and /APPS folder would be automatically controlled by serial updating or .tar file flashing;

- If you want to update firmware and apps:
you only need to use hackrf.app web serial PWA app, or put .tar package into /FIRMWARE folder and user flash utilty app.

- If you want to update official release sdcard resources files:
simply replace (or delete and paste) entire /RES/ folder, since your personal files are not in it.
