Splash screen images files must be 24-bit BMP files of size 240x304 or 240x300 pixels.
The current splash screen image is the one stored in the root directory of the SD card
and named "splash.bmp".  Images stored in the SPLASH folder can be made the current
splash image by clicking on the BMP file in File Manager to view it, and then pressing
the Right button (this will cause the file to be copied to the root folder and renamed
"splash.bmp", overwriting any existing "splash.bmp" file in that location).  In order
for the current splash screen to appear at power up, the "Show splash screen" option
must also be enabled under Settings->UserInterface.
